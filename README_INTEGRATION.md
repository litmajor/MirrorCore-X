# Quantum Elite Trading Interface – Integration & Data Flow

## Overview
This project is a modern React-based trading dashboard (HybridTradingInterface) that is fully wired to a Python FastAPI backend, which in turn is powered by the advanced scanner and analytics pipeline. The UI displays real, analytics-rich market data and advanced signals, not mock data.

## Data Flow & Interconnection

### 1. **Scanner/Analytics Engine**
- Runs on your server, processes market data, and outputs analytics-rich CSV files (e.g., `predictions_1d_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`).
- Each row contains all the fields needed for a `HybridMarketFrame` (price, volume, indicators, advanced analytics, etc.).

### 2. **FastAPI Backend** (`api.py`)
- Exposes a REST endpoint: `GET /frames/{timeframe}`
- On request, finds the latest CSV for the requested timeframe, parses it, and returns a list of `HybridMarketFrame` objects (one per row).
- Each object includes all nested analytics fields (indicators, order flow, microstructure, temporal ghost, etc.), using real values where available and placeholders otherwise.
- CORS is enabled for local React development.

### 3. **React Frontend** (`hybrid_trading_interface.tsx`)
- On load, calls `fetchHybridMarketFrames('1d')` (or other timeframe) to fetch real data from the backend.
- The UI state (`marketData`, `currentFrame`) is set from the backend response.
- All dashboard widgets, charts, and analytics panels display real backend data (no mock data).
- The user can refresh data or switch views (overview, quantum, order flow) and see live analytics.

## How to Run

### 1. **Start the Scanner/Analytics Engine**
- Ensure your scanner is running and outputting up-to-date CSVs in the backend's working directory.

### 2. **Start the FastAPI Backend**
```bash
python api.py
# or
uvicorn api:app --reload
```
- The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/frames/1d` (or other timeframe).

### 3. **Start the React Frontend**
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
- The UI will run on `http://localhost:3000` and automatically fetch data from the backend.

---

## Key Files
- `api.py` – FastAPI backend, exposes `/frames/{timeframe}`
- `hybrid_trading_interface.tsx` – Main React UI, fetches and displays real data
- `services/marketDataProvider.ts` – Helper for API calls from React
- `predictions_1d_*.csv` – Scanner output, consumed by backend

---

## Extending the System
- Add new analytics fields to your scanner and backend, and they will appear in the UI.
- For live data, poll the backend or implement WebSocket streaming.
- For order execution, add new backend endpoints and connect UI actions.

---

## Troubleshooting
- If the UI shows no data, check that the backend is running and CSVs are present.
- If CORS errors occur, ensure the backend allows requests from the frontend's origin.
- For new analytics, update both backend and frontend interfaces as needed.

---

## Summary
This system is now fully integrated: your React UI is directly powered by your scanner's analytics, via a robust FastAPI backend. All data shown is real, actionable, and up-to-date.
